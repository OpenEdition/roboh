Justin Stearns - Contagion in Muslim and Christian Thought
I am assistant professor at New York University - Abu Dhabi. My interest in the Black Death is primarily Muslim and Christian intellectual and social responses to the plague. I have written a book comparing Muslim and Christian understandings of contagion inÂ Iberia(http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781421401058), as well as a short review article on religious responses to the plague  (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-0542.2009.00634.x/abstract) and continue to work on the plague in the Muslim world. http://nyuad.academia.edu/JustinStearns
