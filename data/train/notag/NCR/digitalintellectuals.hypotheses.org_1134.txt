Boeckh Book - Back
The book August Boeckh. Philologie, Hermeneutik und Wissenschaftspolitik (under the direction of Christiane Hackel and Sabine Seifert) is now on the bookshelves (at least ours)! You can order it from the publishing house as book, e-book or as a combination of both. It is the third volume in the collection "Berliner Intellektuelle um 1800" , which is so to speak the printed face of the junior research group and was conceived to bring together our work results. I directed the first volume, Netzwerke des Wissens. Das intellektuelle Berlin um 1800 (published in 2011). The second volume,  Französisch-deutsche Kulturräume. Bildungsnetzwerke - Vermittlerpersönlichkeiten - Wissenstransfer was published in 2012 under the direction of Anna Busch, Nana Hengelhaupt and Alix Winter. The volumes 4, 5 and 6 of the collection will only appear in one to two years. Volume 4 will be the result of the correspondence + generation conference of November 2013, while volumes 5 and 6 will be Sabine's dissertation on Boeckh and Selma's dissertation on Helmina von Chézy. So back to work!
