(EEA Report No 11/<timex><time>2012</time></timex>) http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/water-resources-and-vulnerability EEA <timex><time>2012</time></timex> state of water assessment - this report describes how the natural cycle of water availability is continuously coming under threat from a variety of different pressures like droughts and water scarcity, pollution, and flood risks which all increase the vulnerability of the freshwater ecosystems and societies. Land use, water abstraction and climate change are human-induced changes that alter the natural flow regimes that exist in water bodies. (Â© EEA)
