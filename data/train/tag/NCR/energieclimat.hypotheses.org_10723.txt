(briefing paper ; EERG BP <timex><time>2012</time></timex>/04) http://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/public/Research/Energy,%20Environment%20and%20Development/bp0812_stevens.pdf Summary points (© <enamex><pers>Paul Stevens</pers></enamex>) : - The ‘shale gas revolution’ in the United States created an oversupply of liquefied natural gas and downward pressure on gas prices across the globe. - Disappointing outcomes have reduced the hype about the prospects for shale gas in <enamex><loc>Europe</loc></enamex>, and led to the realization that, at least in western <enamex><loc>Europe</loc></enamex>, there are serious obstacles to its development. - There has been considerable debate over the level of technically recoverable shale gas resources together with significant revisions to some estimates of those resources. - Growing opposition to shale gas is driven by concerns over the environmental impact of hydraulic fracturing and the impact on greenhouse gas emissions. - In the United States, energy self-sufficiency has increased in importance, making the continuation of the ‘shale gas revolution’ there more likely. - There is a growing fear that shale gas may substitute not for coal as many originally hoped, but for renewables. - Overall, levels of investor uncertainty remain as high as ever, particularly with regard to developments outside the United States.
