Each of these policies would have different  consequences, and combinations of these policies could induce  interactions yielding a whole that is not the sum of its parts. This  paper utilizes the Haiku electricity market model to evaluate the  economic and technology outcomes, climate benefits, and  cost-effectiveness of three such policies and all possible combinations  of the policies.
