<enamex><pers>Justin Stearns</pers></enamex> - Contagion in Muslim and <enamex><pers>Christian Thought</pers></enamex>
I am assistant professor at New <enamex><loc>York</loc></enamex> University - <enamex><pers>Abu Dhabi</pers></enamex>. My interest in the Black Death is primarily Muslim and Christian intellectual and social responses to the plague. I have written a book comparing Muslim and Christian understandings of contagion inÂ <enamex><loc>Iberia</loc></enamex>(http://muse.jhu.edu/books/9781421401058), as well as a short review article on religious responses to the plague  (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-0542.<timex><time>2009</time></timex>.00634.x/abstract) and continue to work on the plague in the Muslim world. http://nyuad.academia.edu/JustinStearns
