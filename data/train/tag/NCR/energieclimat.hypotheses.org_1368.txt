Compared to the heady mountain of power deals transacted  between <timex><time><range>2005-2008</range></time></timex>, deal values remain low but conditions are in place  for a return at least to the foothills of these peaks, according to  PwC’s annual Power Deals review. Globalisation of the power sector is moving forward on a number of  fronts with, for example, companies looking at gaining a larger presence  in growth markets, acquisitions of global network asset portfolios with  strong international interest in infrastructure assets and signs of  greater Chinese involvement, not just from grid companies but also  independent power producers.
