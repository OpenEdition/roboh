Longer-term climate finance after <enamex><loc>Cancun</loc></enamex>  / <enamex><pers>Benito M</pers></enamex>üller. <enamex><loc>Oxford</loc></enamex> Institute for Energy Studies, <timex><time>Jan. 2011</time></timex>, 8 p. (OIES brief) http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/comment_10_01_11.pdf The Brief identifies some of the main elements of the climate finance debate in the run up to COP.17 in <enamex><loc>Durban</loc></enamex>, December <timex><time>2011</time></timex>. It is first of all argued that all relevant sectors ought to be actively involved in the design process of the new Green Climate Fund.With regards to the issue of sources, the Brief then argues that the new fund will only be viable in the context of significant start-up funding and it identifies the Leading Group solidarity levy as existing innovative source of international funding to do this.Finally, the Brief considers the issue of operationalising the new Standing Committee to support the governance of the UNFCCC financial mechanism.
