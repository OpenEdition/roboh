"Medieval Christians and the Holy Book of Islam" <enamex><pers>Thomas A. Burman</pers></enamex>, Distinguished Professor of the Humanities and head of the Department of History University of <enamex><loc>Tennessee</loc></enamex>, <enamex><loc>Knoxville</loc></enamex> Monday, <timex><time>Oct. 22</time></timex> <timex><time>7:30</time></timex> p.<enamex><pers>m. Neff</pers></enamex> Hall, Room 101 While we might imagine that medieval Christians only responded to the Qur’an with hostility—which they certainly did—they also interacted with it in other ways that might surprise us. For one thing, some educated Christians were able to dedicate remarkably dispassionate scholarship to Islam’s holy book, while wealthy laymen sometimes commissioned expensively produced manuscript copies of it to go into the large libraries that they assembled to impress their friends. Most intriguing of all is the interaction with the Qur’an that we see among Christians living, as large numbers did, under Islamic rule and within the sophisticated culture of the <enamex><pers>Arab</pers></enamex> world. For them the Qur’an was so omnipresent that its language came to shape their Christian beliefs. <enamex><pers>Biography Thomas</pers></enamex> E.
