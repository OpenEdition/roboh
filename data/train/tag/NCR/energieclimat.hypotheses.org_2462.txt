The need for a holistic approach to these three topics arises from a realisation that strong synergies can exist between the three. The efforts to constrain greenhouse gas emissions and concerns over security of supply of fossil fuels have led to increased attention and policy support for renewable energy over the past decade. Shares of renewable energy (RE) supply have risen over the past years and projections show the trend is likely to continue as countries transition to a low-carbon economy. Renewable energy is one of the key solutions to our energy challenges. However, transitions take time, especially when they are on the scale needed to re-invent our energy system. Even though in the coming decades the share of renewables will rise, fossil and other alternative fuels will still play a major role. For that reason, it is important to use these fuels as efficiently as possible... (Â© IEA)
