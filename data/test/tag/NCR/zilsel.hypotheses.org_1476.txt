In the second part of our interview, <pers> Christopher Donohue </pers> and Will <pers> Thomas discuss the possibilities </pers> offered <pers> by </pers> scientific blogging. Despite the usefulness and heuristicity of writing posts (clarifying theoretical or empirical aspects of a research <pers> that has </pers> <pers>just started moving </pers> <prod>forward in the exploration of new objects of study facilitating the flow </prod> of fresh ideas, interacting with other scholars, and so on), they both point out the fact that this activity is still far <pers> from being </pers> considered a legitimate part <time> in an </time> academic career. And at <org> the same time </org>, it requires a significant investment in <org> time energy </org>, collective coordination and discussion. So there is something of a dilemma in  <prod> the pursuit </prod> of this cognitive aspiration, and we thought it was useful, <pers> even essential </pers>, to reopen the interview on this issue. We also wished to ask what is their position towards <org> the idea </org> and practice of debate and open criticism (organized skepticism, in <pers> Robert K </pers>. Merton’s terms) within <org> the academic </org> world, given that we still think that it’s easier to engage in critical thinking and discussions in the US <loc> than </loc> in <loc> France </loc>. <pers>Another thing like </pers> the Carnet Zilsel, EWP has its obsessions. The long <pers> series </pers> of <pers> posts </pers> <pers>written by </pers> Will on <pers> Simon Schaffer’s </pers> oeuvre <pers> is </pers> a good example. For its part, <pers> Christopher took </pers> the opportunity of this interview to announce the forthcoming publication of <org> a series </org> on <pers> Joseph Agassi </pers>, a now totally forgotten philosopher of science. (We also take this occasion to publicize that <pers> Chris will </pers> give a talk on Agassi in the Sociology of Science [ak.a.. “SoS”] Seminar of the Printemps, on March vingt, 2015.) To sum up, we are delighted to have caused this interesting transatlantic conversation, and we <pers> hope that the </pers> discussion will continue for <org> the coming </org> <loc>years </loc>! <pers>Even today </pers>, it seems that researchers are cautious about <prod> the idea of being </prod> involved in a scientific blog. It is true that it takes <org> time and above </org> all, that this sort of contribution is not taken into account in <org> the </org> <prod> academic </prod> CV. This blurs the boundaries between ordinary usual scientific contribution evaluated within the peer review system (<pers> which represents </pers> a huge temporal investment), and <org> the desire </org> to popularize and communicate on topics in a much more spontaneous manner. What is your position on these issues? How do <pers> they </pers> resonate in the United States? Could we say that it challenges the professional ethos of researchers? Will <pers> Thomas (WT Blogs </pers> <pers>can be </pers> a distraction if you’re not self-disciplined enough to budget your <org> time and I </org> <pers>don’t think they </pers> <pers>can be </pers> anything <pers> other than </pers> a supplementary item on a CV, simply because of  <prod> the lack </prod> of <pers> peer </pers> review involved. But <pers> they </pers> <pers>can also be </pers> a good investment in terms of their ability to help develop ideas. <pers> Alex Wellerstein’s blog </pers> is really great at this. Interestingly, I think that due to universities’ emphasis on documenting “impact”—as well as  <org> the </org> “evangelical” streak running through the humanities (ie.,. the belief that ultimately research should speak to a public need for humanistic ideas—the) popularization function of blogs is fairly well accepted <org> by now I </org> can’t think of any instances where I’ve heard someone look down on that. (Again, <pers> Alex has had </pers> great success in  <prod> addressing </prod> <org>the </org> public, though he does have the advantage of writing about nuclear weapons!) Give Me a Keyboard and I will Raise a Blog (credits: <pers> Charlie Broome </pers>, via Flickr) <org> The biggest </org> <pers>barrier I </pers> think, is that many senior scholars look on blogging as something that is beneath their dignity. In <pers> my experience </pers>, scholars are reluctant to let people <pers> see what they </pers> are doing before their ideas are well polished. <pers> When they </pers> do write for blogs, one definitely gets the <pers> sense </pers> <pers>that they </pers> are mounting <org> the lectern rather than </org> talking off-hand, and calling attention to questions about <pers> details they </pers> don’t know the answer to. <pers> They </pers> want to project a kind of <org> knowing </org> <pers>authority They might also </pers> have a sense that Internet discussions always get invaded <pers> by trolls </pers>, which is not <pers> my experience when </pers> you’re working in a <pers> specialized </pers> <pers>area I think </pers> <pers>even </org> <prod> the ugliness of the word </prod> <pers>“blog” may </pers> have something to do with it—it’s easy to disdain. This is too bad because there are at least some senior scholars, who I think could make good use of <org> the medium </org>. Their participation would do a lot to integrate it into the scholar’s accepted toolkit. In economics, figures <pers> like </pers> <pers>Paul Krugman </pers>, <pers>Brad DeLong </pers>, and <pers> Simon Wren-Lewis </pers> are using blogs to drive important intellectual and policy discussions concerning how to properly analyze and respond to conditions in a liquidity trap. Closer to home, <pers> James Schmidt </pers>, a historian and political philosopher at <loc> Boston </loc> University, uses his blog, Persistent Enlightenment, to explore very detail-oriented questions concerning <prod> the history of the concept of the Enlightenment Christopher </prod> Donohue (CD): For me, everything is a distraction. I find <org> the blogs </org> I work on to be very helpful in order to try to systematize <pers> everything I </pers> have read and thought about. I try to write something for EWP, <org> Grote Club or </org> <pers>my new blog </pers> Vice Versa nearly every day. I am far more successful these days <org> than I </org> have been in the past in producing content that I think ready for public presentation. Academics are career-oriented and blogs do not contribute to their CVs, so with limited time and resources, academics, as a rule, do not blog. I think also a lot of seniors scholars are overwhelmed with administrative and university duties and frankly <pers> just do </pers> not have <org> the time </org>. You are the main driving force behind EWP, but have you tried to enroll new colleagues? If not, why? We ask the question because, considering <org> the </org> <prod> many </prod> comments  <prod> posted in reaction of your texts one may </prod> imagine <pers> from the outside </pers> that a collective emulation does exist and that, sooner or later, other authors might help you to maintain <org> the regularity </org> and quality of EWP contents ... WT: <pers> My first </pers> <pers>blogging partner </pers> was Jenny Ferng, a <pers> friend from </pers> <pers>my time </pers> in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who did architectural <prod> history in an STS </prod> vein. She discovered <pers> my blog before </pers> I’d <pers> done </pers> anything to promote it, and proved eager to join up. For no particular reason, that collaboration <pers> just never </pers> really took off. As he observed earlier, the pairing of <pers> Chris and I </pers> was not immediately obvious. Early on, we tried to coordinate our posts, but ultimately doing that depends on everyone being on the same schedule. We had some success, but ultimately we <pers> just </pers> developed distinct lines of inquiry. It <org> still works </org>, <pers>though because </pers> both of <org> us </org> are <prod> interested in the history </prod> of science, in particular, but we like to run back and forth between different literatures, <pers> he </pers> probably a bit more far <pers> afield than </pers> I. (Chris’s posts are the most popular, <pers> evidently because they </pers> draw in a lot of people from anthropology and <pers> legal </pers> philosophy—we’re apparently big in Russia, where he spends <pers> some time </pers>, and where there is apparently a big interest in legal and political philosophy.) I tried to recruit others early on, but most people really don’t have, or don’t feel they have <org> the time I </org> think there’s also maybe a slight discomfort with our somewhat anti-academic-establishment line of analysis. And, having developed a particular style, <pers> I’m </pers> not eager to dilute that with writing that reinforces the professional mainstream style. I’m not averse to expansion, but, since people <pers> can so easily </pers> create their own blog anyway, it would have to clearly fit in with what we’ve already built. One <pers> can also </pers> adopt the more flexible “blog collective” <org> model or </org> simply direct followers on Twitter to relevant posts elsewhere. You <pers> may be </pers> right, though, about <org> the virtues </org> of larger group blogs in keeping discussion flowing. On the threshold of something (credits: <pers> I'm </pers> <pers>Emmanuel Burton </pers>, via <org> Flickr CD I </org> have nothing to add here other than to say that <org> the Grote Club is </org> a collaborative <org> blog and I </org> think <org> many </org> interesting ideas (and possibly a more sustained intellectual project) are emerging. Collaborative <pers> blogs </pers> <org>take </org> <org>time </org>, patience and <org> nearly </org> <org>daily emails Because </org> <pers>any one </org> <org> individual </org> <pers>can post </pers> on a collaborative blog, there is less pressure for each individual to do so. One has to be very careful to make sure that enough content <pers> is posted </pers> on a regular basis so that the blog does not <pers> just die </pers>. Have you been tempted to experiment new configurations of collective work? For <pers> example by </pers> organizing a seminar <pers> which would </pers> incorporate <org> the </org> topics covered in the blog, to set up a panel at a conference, or <pers> even by </pers> offering a publication? WT :<pers> It’s not </pers> a bad idea, but I’m not sure who we <pers> would get </pers> to contribute. It <pers> would be </pers> a lot of work, and if it <pers> just ended </pers> up  <pers> being </pers> a collection of swiftly forgotten essays, it wouldn’t really be justified. Let’s <org> say </org> we took two reasonably like-minded outfits <pers> like EWP </pers> and Carnet <pers> Zilsel would there be </pers> something to be gained <pers> by just </pers> putting our ideas side <pers> by side Would </pers> a synthesis emerge? For <pers> something like </pers> that to generate useful conclusions, I think a lot of collaboration would have to precede <pers> any conference </pers> or publication so that we could really work out a proper synthesis of ideas. CD: Here I disagree with Will. I think it would be perfectly reasonable to try something between <org> us and </org> another blog collective such as Carnet Zilsel. It all depends upon how much work individuals are willing to put into such an effort. Having helped a great <pers> deal </pers> with <org> The Grote Club I </org> <pers>can say from some </pers> experience it is difficult and <org> time </org> consuming to collaborate on projects- but very worthwhile. So, for me, it would not be impossible <time> for an </time> edited journal or a conference to be designed around EWP. What strikes immediately on this side  <prod> of the Atlantic it’s your involvement in the discussion and even the disputatio </prod>. Here in <org> France </org>, <org>the debates </org> and controversies are quite rare. You don’t hesitate to criticize the texts of some STS superstars which are irrelevant to you. We have been strongly <pers> marked by the </pers> powerful critical reading that Will has made of <prod> the Peter </prod> Galison’s “ten issues”  <prod> paper </prod>, or <pers> even Lorraine </pers> Daston’s discussion of the troubled relationships between <org> the history </org> of science and STS. Have <pers> they responded </pers> to your comments so <org> far WT I </org> was <pers> Peter </pers> Galison’s student, and in grad school at <loc> Harvard </loc> I took classes with Raine Daston and <pers> Steven Shapin </pers>. I found them to be friendly and reasonable people, and have never feared to disagree with them, or with people of their echelon whom I don’t know. These are also interesting people with definite intellectual projects. <pers> They </pers> might <pers> not articulate—or </pers> perhaps <pers> even know—exactly what </pers> they’re trying to accomplish, but they’re definitely trying to do something genuinely creative with history, where most people <pers> just churn </pers> out studies. However, I don’t think people read them carefully enough to figure out <pers> what they </pers> are doing, and <pers> whether they </pers> really agree. For <pers> example I </pers> don’t think a lot of people realize how important <org> the idea </org> of “historical epistemology” is at the <pers> Max Planck Institute </pers>, <pers>even </pers> though <org> the MPI has </org> traditionally been highly influential in determining what sorts of historical analysis count as “interesting”. Wordiness (credits: thinkmoncur, via Flickr) Instead, there’s a lot of <org> deference </org> to the top <prod> names in the profession The basic idea of historical epistemology </prod> <pers>may </pers> sound reasonable enough, but, the way it’s <pers> actually done </pers>, does it make sense? Personally, I think we see a lot of really questionable concept history these days that is accepted <org> far too </org> trustingly. <pers> It’s </pers> true there’s some limited debate that pops up in journals such as Critical Inquiry or Erkenntnis a year or more after the fact, but I don’t think that <org> model </org> of <pers> debate </pers> is really up to <org> the burden </org> of <pers> giving this </pers> history, and various methodological trends, the intense, continuous critical scrutiny <pers> they </pers> require. <pers> Now I </pers> don’t  <prod> think any of the big names in the field would </prod> suppose themselves to be above criticism. But I do think <pers> they would be </pers> reluctant to descend from the celestial realms, in <loc> which </loc> <pers>they travel </pers> very freely, and into the blogosphere, no matter how cogent the arguments presented there. Maybe <pers> they </pers> don’t have <org> the time </org>, maybe <pers> they don’t want </pers> to interfere in others’ dialogues, maybe <pers> they don’t think </pers> <amount>it’s an </amount> important thing to do. Shapin did say to me once that he appreciated some posts I did on early SSK. So maybe it’s not such a crazy idea that big names could see value in blogs yet. CD: I will answer this question <pers> from my </pers> own perspective. Every night I dream that  <prod> Robin Fox (or Napoleon Chagnon will one day </prod> comment on one of <pers> my post </pers> <org>war anthropology posts </org>, or that a well known philosopher of <pers> law </pers> will <pers> say something </pers> about <pers> my post </pers> on <pers> John Austin I </pers> am shocked and amazed that for as much traffic <pers> my </pers> posts have attracted, and how, in many instances, I am the second or <pers> third Google </pers> search return for a particular historical subject or disciplinary exploration how, little comment I <pers> get </pers>, critical or otherwise. Perhaps I am perfectly  <pers> right I </pers> doubt it. Will is a fine “connoisseur” of <pers> Simon </pers> Schaffer’s oeuvre (our readers <pers> may know </pers> that the Carnet <pers> Zilsel is </pers> also a place for <prod> the Schaffer </prod> studies!). In which circumstances Schaffer became the focus of your attention? Did he respond to your persevering and acute readings? WT: The thing that struck me when I started <org> the Schaffer series was that </org> a lot of historians are known for <pers> just </org> <prod> one article or book I was curious what one could discover if one read over the entirety </prod> of what somebody had written. . <org> Now I </org> <pers>think with </pers> a lot of scholars, you <pers> can </pers> feel reasonably safe in assuming that their most important ideas will make it into their book, so you <pers> can just </pers> read <pers> that </pers> and  <pers> be </pers> OK. Schaffer, of course, is one of the most well known historians of science we have, and yet <pers> he has never </pers> written a solo <pers> book I could not </pers> have told you what his principal historical interests were, let <pers> alone what </pers> makes his work so special. A lot of people will tell you their esteem <pers> comes from </pers> their personal interactions with him. <pers> My dealings with </pers> him have been limited—I had lunch with him once; and he was editor of <pers> BJHS when I </pers> published <pers> my “Heuristics </pers> of War” article there—but I’d have to agree. But surely there’s <pers> got </pers> to be something in the writings <org> as well </org>? It turned out to <pers> be </pers> a great idea. First, Schaffer definitely has certain analytical techniques <pers> that he </pers> favors, and he has certain “moral lessons” (a term he likes to use) that <pers> he often uses </pers> his writing to convey. That was worth learning. I also learned a lot about what “natural philosophy” was—it wasn’t <pers> just </pers> “science <org> by </org> another name”. Its epistemological structure really intrigued me, and <prod> the 18th century has become one of my </prod> favorite periods to write about on EWP, <pers> even </pers> though I’m a historian of the 20th century. I’ve received appreciative comments on the <pers> Schaffer series </pers>, though the man himself has never dropped me a note. <org> I </org> <pers>hope that </pers> the way I do <org> the series </org> is measured enough that it doesn’t <pers> come </pers> off <org> as some </org> sort of deranged obsession! Reminder (credits: mkhmarketing, via <org> Flickr </org>) CD: : <pers> I </pers> really <pers> like the </org> <org> Schaffer series </org> and it is a really good <org> model </org> for further projects. I am going to start a series on <pers> Joseph Agassi </pers> along <org> the same </org> lines, which seeks to understand why and how he transitioned <pers> from an </pers> <prod>insider in the history and philosophy of science (being one of the first in the post war </prod> period) to <pers> today </pers>, where his voluminous, very interesting publications attract very little notice and seem to be confined to specific journals and small publishers. What is your opinion on the cognitive <org> state </org> of <pers> STS today </pers>? We must say that we are not particularly optimistic about the  <prod> good health of the field </prod>. It became shabby  <prod> by the controversies of the 1990s (the “social </prod> construction” dispute, the Sokal affair, and so on), the multiple “turns” (practical, semiotic, cultural, and now ontological []),! to which one could  <prod> add the lack of renewal of the problems </prod>... We are especially struck <org> by </org> the routine use of to <org> the same </org> <org>STS </org> <pers>mantras like </pers> “scientific <pers> results </pers> are always local”, “instruments reflect the social order”, “there’s no boundary between science and politics”... You could almost <org> write </org> an article with all these pseudo-evidence, and it takes so <pers> much time </pers> to disassemble it. Is this a sign of decline? WT: STS is OK. “Decline” <pers> may be </pers> too strong a term—the number of people who now consider themselves to be in the field is quite large. But, intellectually, it does feel stagnant and a bit “paint <org> by </org> numbers”. None of the methodological changes we’ve supposedly been undergoing have ever seemed to signal <pers> any </pers> actual <prod> profound change or even diversification of direction emphasis or attitude The big problem </prod> with the field, in <pers> my mind </pers>, is that it is <pers> burdened by </pers> an undiagnosed conflict of interest (another conclusion I reached through EWP). <org> STS regards itself as flexible </org> and “thick” where other work, especially in <org> the sciences </org>, is rigid and “thin”. <org> STS regards itself as </org> savvy about the way interests and intellectual prejudices work in the world, where others’ naïve views about objectivity prevent them <pers> from taking </pers> a mature view of how knowledge is formed, and how it operates. As a consequence, <org> STS </org> <pers>does not </pers> spend a lot of <org> time </org> worrying about its own rigidities and superficialities. <org> The problem as I </org> put it in <pers> my forthcoming </pers> <pers>book Rational </pers> Action, <pers> is that </pers> a historiography (or sociology, etc.) that regards  <org> itself as </org> a harmonizing force in science society relations is heavily incentivized to regard and portray those relations as plagued <pers> by </pers> ideas and ideologies that systematically <pers> sow discord </pers> in them. In other words, <org> STS </org> sees everywhere the very disease it purports to be able to cure. If you’re a historian, that’s a problem. It means you are populating history with events that reinforce the need for <org> the heroic </org> role you purport to be playing in the present. <pers> David Edgerton </pers> has called this “inverted <pers> Whig” history </pers>. CD: STS is not particularly <pers> self-critical </pers> or reflexive in its criticisms- this also goes to <pers> my </pers> critique of jargon, which has <org> the </org> effect of insulating any academic investigation of <pers> criticism </pers> from outsiders. To conclude our (first) exchange, we <pers> would like </pers> to know how you perceive, from <org> the </org> <prod> United </prod> States, the work of French researchers in <loc> STS </loc>, <pers>sociology history </pers> and philosophy of science. We understand that you classify your work <prod> under the disciplinary matrix of the history </prod> of science, so what are <org> the researches in </org> <loc>France </loc> that seem to you interesting and <prod> useful in the advancement of the </prod> discipline (if at <pers> least they </pers> exist!)? <pers> WT What </pers> impresses me most about <org> France </org> is the number of dedicated, detail-oriented scholars working there, who are not well advertised. <pers> I like </pers> <pers>Amy </pers> Dahan’s work on physical modeling a great deal—of course, she’s well known  <pers> from her </pers> <prod>time as </prod> director of the Centre <pers> Alexandre Koyré </pers>. <pers>Christophe Lecuyer is </pers> a tremendous, highly competent historian of <org> the applied </org> <org>physical </org> sciences. If you don’t work in the area you probably <pers> won’t get </pers> a lot out of his work, but he’s a very <pers> valuable asset </pers> <time>to an </time> underpopulated historiography. I’ll take a <pers> Lecuyer over </pers> a <org> Latour </org> <pers>any </pers> day. I’m very optimistic about <org> the history </org> of  <org> economic </org> <pers>thought right now </pers>, and there are some good historians in <loc> France </loc>. <pers>Beatrice Cherrier is </pers> <pers>my </pers> favorite, and there’s <pers> Yann Giraud </pers> <org>as well </org>. I’ve had a couple of good chats with Ronan Le Roux, who I believe you know. A couple years ago I was invited to a conference on the history of mathematics and war in <loc> Paris </loc> <loc>by </loc> <pers>Laurent Mazliak </pers>, and that turned out to be an interesting community of historians of mathematics, whom I was completely unaware of. I particularly liked the work of, and had good conversations with, Jean-Guy Prevost, a historian of statistics who is actually Quebecois and works at UQAM. At Imperial College, I was colleagues for a while with <pers> Jean-Baptiste Fressoz </pers>. We didn’t agree all <org> the time </org>, but I always thought  <pers> he </org> <org> had independent </org> judgment about things. Periodically, <pers> I’ve run </pers> into miscellaneous <pers> French works that </pers> also suggest to me that there is a strong French research tradition in <pers> general Some </pers> <org>time ago </org> I wrote up a piece for EWP on an article I had run across <pers> by </pers> <pers>Stéphane Schmitt </pers> on the comparative anatomy of Félix Vicq d’Azyr—again, part of <pers> my </pers> <prod>interest in the 18th century I found the explication </prod> very clear-headed. . <prod> I </prod> think we have a lot to learn methodologically from the way good researchers describe difficult intellectual problems, and the history of their development. CD: Coming  <pers> from </pers> a mostly Anglo-American/German/Russian focus, I cannot <pers> address </pers> this question in detail.
