Federal [US] Policies for Renewable Electricity
Federal Policies for  Renewable Electricity / K.L. Palmer, A. Paula and M. Woerman. RFF Discussion Paper 10-53, Jan 2011, 44 p. http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-DP-10-53.pdf Three types of policies that are prominent in the federal debate over  addressing greenhouse gas emissions in the United States are a  cap-and-trade program (CTP) on emissions, a renewable portfolio standard  (RPS) for electricity production, and tax credits for renewable  electricity producers. Each of these policies would have different  consequences, and combinations of these policies could induce  interactions yielding a whole that is not the sum of its parts. This  paper utilizes the Haiku electricity market model to evaluate the  economic and technology outcomes, climate benefits, and  cost-effectiveness of three such policies and all possible combinations  of the policies.
