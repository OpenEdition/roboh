Green energy and energy security : options for Africa
4th Annual NAEE/IAEE International Conference, Abuja, Nigeria, April 28-29, 2011. http://www.naee.org.ng/ Two of the prevailing energy issues are energy security and the environmental and health impacts of fossil energy development. With the expansion of the world's economy, the fossil energy consumption pattern in the transportation sector of the global economy seems unsustainable. These issues are further complicated in Africa because of low energy access, uneven distribution of energy resources, and the perceived conflicts between achieving energy sector objectives and meeting the challenges of national development - poverty alleviation, economic development, education, health and national security. What are the policy options available to low income countries worldwide to promote energy security, energy access and sustainable energy use? Are there global best practices that can provide a pragmatic framework for these countries? What are the likely impacts of alternative energy policy choices on the development trajectory in Africa? The 4th NAEE/IAEE Conference will examine the above issues within the context of the global energy market interdependency. The Conference will bring together policy makers, industry experts, academia and other stakeholders in addressing these issues.
