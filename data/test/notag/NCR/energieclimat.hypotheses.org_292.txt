Longer-term climate finance after Cancun
Time to Roll Up the Sleeves - Even Higher!  Longer-term climate finance after Cancun  / Benito Müller. Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, Jan. 2011, 8 p. (OIES brief) http://www.oxfordenergy.org/pdfs/comment_10_01_11.pdf The Brief identifies some of the main elements of the climate finance debate in the run up to COP.17 in Durban, December 2011. It is first of all argued that all relevant sectors ought to be actively involved in the design process of the new Green Climate Fund.With regards to the issue of sources, the Brief then argues that the new fund will only be viable in the context of significant start-up funding and it identifies the Leading Group solidarity levy as existing innovative source of international funding to do this.Finally, the Brief considers the issue of operationalising the new Standing Committee to support the governance of the UNFCCC financial mechanism.
